**Abstract**

 The aim of this paper is to enable a multi-GPU computational framework for simulating high-resolution biomechanical head and neck deformations for radiotherapy dose monitoring purposes. The biomechanical model incorporates subject-specific youngâ€™s modulus and shear modulus properties and is actuated using daily patient positioning images. The computational tasks of the biomechanical model were off-loaded to a multi-GPU framework enabling real-time biomechanical deformations. The results show the biomechanical head and neck model could be deformed at a rate of 20-40 frames per second. The model deformations indicated changes in the stress at different parts of the treatment as the head and neck posture varied from one treatment fraction to another.
